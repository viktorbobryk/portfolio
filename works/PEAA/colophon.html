				<p>This is the first book that I wrote using XML and related technologies. The master text was written as a series of XML documents using trusty TextPad. I also used a home-grown DTD. While I was working I used XSLT to generate the web pages for the HTML site. For the diagrams I relied on my old friend Visio using Pavel Hruby's wonderful UML templates (much better than those that come with the tool. I have a link on my Web site if you want them.) I wrote a small program that automatically imported the code examples into the output, which saved me from the usual nightmare of code cut and paste. For my first draft I tried XSL-FO with Apache FOP. At the time it wasn't quite up to the job, so for later work I wrote scripts in XSLT and Ruby to import the text into FrameMaker.<p>
				<p>I used several open source tools while working on this book—in particular, JUnit, NUnit, ant, Xerces, Xalan, Tomcat, Jboss, Ruby, and Hsql. My thanks to the many developers of these tools. There was also a long list IDE that's excited me since Smalltalk—for Java.</p>
				<p>The book was acquired for Addison Wesley by Mike Hendrickson who, assisted by Ross Venables, has supervised its publication. I started work on the manuscript in November 2000 and released the final draft to production in June 2002. As I write this, the book is due for release in November 2002 at OOPSLA.</p>
				<p>Sarah Weaver was the production editor, coordinating the editing, composition, proofreading, indexing, and production of final files. Dianne Wood was the copy editor, carrying out the tricky job of cleaning up my English without introducing any untoward refinement. Kim Arney Mulcahy composed the book into the design you see here, cleaned up the diagrams, set the text in Sabon, and prepared the final Framemaker files for the printer. The text design is based on the format we used for Refactoring. Cheryl Ferguson proofread the pages and ferreted out any errors that had slipped through the cracks. Irv Hershman prepared the index.</p>
				<h2>About the Cover Picture</h2>
				<p>During the couple of years I spent writing this book a more significant construction project was going on in Boston. The Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge (try fitting that name on a road sign) will replace the ugly double-decker that now carries Interstate 93 over the Charles River. The Zakim bridge is a cable-stayed bridge, a style that hasn't been widely used in the U.S. so far, but is very popular in Europe. The Zakim bridge isn't particularly long, but it is the world's widest cable-stayed bridge and also the first U.S. cablestayed bridge to have an asymmetric design. It's a very beautiful bridge, but that doesn't stop me from teasing Cindy about Henry Petroski's conjecture that we are due for a major failure in a cable-stayed bridge
