				<p>I've written this book for programmers, designers, and architects who are building enterprise applications	and who want to improve either their understanding of architectural issues or their communication about	them.</p>
				<p>I'm assuming that most of my readers will fall into two groups: those with modest needs who are looking to	build their own software and readers with more demanding needs who will be using a tool. For those of	modest needs, my intention is that these patterns should get you started. In many areas you'll need more	than the patterns will give you, but I'll provide you more of a headstart in this field than I got. For tool users	I hope this book will give you some idea of what's happening under the hood and also help you choose which	of the tool-supported patterns to use. Using, say, an object-relational mapping tool still means that you have	to make decisions about how to map certain situations. Reading the patterns should give you some guidance	in making the choices.</p>
				<p>There is a third category; those with demanding needs who want to build their own software. The first thing	I'd say here is to look carefully at using tools. I've seen more than one project get sucked into a long	exercise at building frameworks, which wasn't what the project was really about. If you're still convinced, go	ahead. Remember in this case that many of the code examples in this book are deliberately simplified to	help understanding, and you'll find you'll need to do a lot tweaking to handle the greater demands you face.</p>
				<p>Since patterns are common solutions to recurring problems, there's a good chance that you have already	come across some of them. If you've been working in enterprise applications for a while, you may well know	most of them. I'm not claiming to present anything new in this book. Indeed, I claim the oppositeâ€”this is a	book of (for our industry) old ideas. If you're new to this field, I hope the book will help you learn about	these techniques. If you're familiar with the techniques, I hope the book will help you communicate and	teach them to others. An important part of patterns is trying to build a common vocabulary, so you can say	that this class is a Remote Facade (388) and other designers will know what you mean.</p>
